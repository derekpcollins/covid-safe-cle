# COVID-safe Bars & Restaurants in Cleveland

This is a list of bars & restaurants throughout the Cleveland area that require proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test within the last 72-24 hours (this differs by location).

*Last updated January 19, 2022*

1. **[LBM](http://www.lbmbar.com/), 12301 Madison Ave., Lakewood**: A self-described viking bar that plays loud metal music and serves up Japanese-inspired dishes. While LBM is primarily a cocktail bar, they do offer a wide selection of canned and bottled beer as well as a basic red and white wine.
2. **[Toast](https://www.toastcleveland.com), 1365 West 65th Street, Cleveland**: "Toast is a warm and friendly wine bar in Cleveland’s Gordon Square arts district," that serves, "wholesome, scratch-made food & cocktails made from local, sustainably-sourced ingredients."
3. **[Felice Urban Cafe](http://feliceurbancafe.com/), 12502 Lachmere Boulevard, Cleveland**
4. **[MOJO World Eats](https://www.mojocle.com), 2196 Lee Road, Cleveland Heights**
5. **[Happy Dog](https://happydogcleveland.com), 5801 Detroit Ave., Cleveland**: "The Happy Dog is a neighborhood corner bar," that serves, "hot dogs and beer, and lots of live music, from rock and country to punk and polka."

10. **[The Cleveland Orchestra](https://www.clevelandorchestra.com), 11001 Euclid Ave., Cleveland**: "As of January 3, 2022, Guests will be required to show proof of full Covid-19 vaccination (two doses, plus a booster, per CDC guidelines)... Guests who are unable to be vaccinated or have not received their booster dose will be required to provide proof of a negative Covid test."

## Honorable Mentions
These are a few places that don't directly require proof of vaccination, but I've found to be safer than most places for one reason or another.

1. **[Mahall's Twenty Lanes](http://mahalls20lanes.com/), 13200 Madison Ave., Lakewood**: This bar includes a music venue and – as the name suggests – twenty bowling lanes. You'll find a nice list of cocktails, canned and bottled beers, and red and white wine as well as some great bar food (e.g. hamburgers, sandwhiches, fries, etc.). While the bar itself doesn't require proof of vaccination, the associated music venue does, so you can be pretty sure that most of the people there are vaccinated.
2. **[Western Reserve](https://www.westernreservedistillers.com), 14221 Madison Ave., Lakewood**: Western Reserve is a distillery in Lakewood that has an attached restaurant where they serve their local spirits along with a couple of craft beers on tap and a great food menu. The reason it is on this list is that they have a great little outdoor bar with garage-style windows that open to the inside and they've always allowed me to sit outside even when it's cold and snowing. So if the weather is tolerable to you, then this is a great place where you can sit outside and enjoy a drink or some nice food.
